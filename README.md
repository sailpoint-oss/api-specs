# Add a new API to the Postman Collection

To add a new API collection to the Postman Collection, open https://github.com/sailpoint-oss/api-specs/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-dereferenced-spec.yml and add the following:

- Under `paths`, add the one or more paths to the API files
```yaml
paths:
  - idn/sailpoint-api.v3.yaml
  - idn/v3/**
```
- Under the "Dereference API Specification and build Postman collection" step, add the commands to dereference the spec and build the collection
```yaml
- name: Dereference API Specification and build Postman collection
  run: |
    swagger-cli bundle --dereference idn/sailpoint-api.v2024.yaml -t yaml -o dereferenced/deref-sailpoint-api.v2024.yaml
    openapi2postmanv2 -s dereferenced/deref-sailpoint-api.v2024.yaml -o postman/collections/sailpoint-api-v2024.json -p -c postman-script/openapi2postman-config.json
    node postman-script/modify-collection.js postman/collections/sailpoint-api-v2024.json
    swagger-cli bundle --dereference idn/sailpoint-api.v2024.yaml -t json -o dereferenced/deref-sailpoint-api.v2024.
