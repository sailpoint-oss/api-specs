their organizations' use.\nCertification campaigns provide Identity Security Cloud users with an interactive review process they can use to identify and verify access to systems.\nCampaigns help organizations reduce risk of inappropriate access and satisfy audit requirements.\n\nA certification refers to Identity Security Cloud's mechanism for reviewing a user's access to entitlements (sets of permissions) and approving or removing that access.\nThese certifications serve as a way of showing that a user's access has been reviewed and approved.\nMultiple certifications by different reviewers are often required to approve a user's access.\nA set of multiple certifications is called a certification campaign.\n\nFor example, an organization may use a Manager Certification campaign as a way of showing that a user's access has been reviewed and approved by multiple managers.\nOnce this campaign has been completed, Identity Security Cloud would provision all the access the user needs, nothing more.\n\nIdentity Security Cloud provides two simple campaign types users can create without using search queries, Manager and Source Owner campaigns:\n\nYou can create these types of campaigns without using any search queries in Identity Security Cloud:\n\n- ManagerCampaign: Identity Security Cloud provides this campaign type as a way to ensure that an identity's access is certified by their managers.\nYou only need to provide a name and description to create one.\n\n- Source Owner Campaign: Identity Security Cloud provides this campaign type as a way to ensure that an identity's access to a source is certified by its source owners.\nYou only need to provide a name and description to create one.\nYou can specify the sources whose owners you want involved or just run it across all sources.\n\nFor more information about these campaign types, refer to [Starting a Manager or Source Owner Campaign](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/certs/starting_campaign.html).\n\nOne useful way to create certification campaigns in Identity Security Cloud is to use a specific search and then run a campaign on the results returned by that search.\nThis allows you to be much more specific about whom you are certifying in your campaigns and what access you are certifying in your campaigns.\nFor example, you can search for all identities who are managed by \"Amanda.Ross\" and also have the access to the \"Accounting\" role and then run a certification campaign based on that search to ensure that the returned identities are appropriately certified.\n\nYou can use Identity Security Cloud search queries to create these types of campaigns:\n\n- Identities: Use this campaign type to review and revoke access items for specific identities.\nYou can either build a search query and create a campaign certifying all identities returned by that query, or you can search for individual identities and add those identities to the certification campaign.\n\n- Access Items: Use this campaign type to review and revoke a set of roles, access profiles, or entitlements from the identities that have them.\nYou can either build a search query and create a campaign certifying all access items returned by that query, or you can search for individual access items and add those items to the certification campaign.\n\n- Role Composition: Use this campaign type to review a role's composition, including its title, description, and membership criteria.\nYou can either build a search query and create a campaign certifying all roles returned by that query, or you can search for individual roles and add those roles to the certification campaign.\n\n- Uncorrelated Accounts: Use this campaign type to certify source accounts that aren't linked to an authoritative identity in Identity Security Cloud.\nYou can use this campaign type to view all the uncorrelated accounts for a source and certify them.\n\nFor more information about search-based campaigns, refer to [Starting a Campaign from Search](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/certs/starting_search_campaign.html).\n\nOnce you have generated your campaign, it becomes available for preview.\nAn administrator can review the campaign and make changes, or if it's ready and accurate, activate it.\n\nOnce the campaign is active, organization administrators or certification administrators can designate other Identity Security Cloud users as certification reviewers.\nThose reviewers can view any of the certifications they either need to review (active) or have already reviewed (completed).\n\nWhen a certification campaign is in progress, certification reviewers see the listed active certifications whose involved identities they can review.\nReviewers can then make decisions to grant or revoke access, as well as reassign the certification to another reviewer. If the reviewer chooses this option, they must provide a reason for reassignment in the form of a comment.\n\nOnce a reviewer has made decisions on all the certification's involved access items, he or she must \"Sign Off\" to complete the review process.\nDoing so converts the certification into read-only status, preventing any further changes to the review decisions and deleting the work item (task) from the reviewer's list of work items.\n\nOnce all the reviewers have signed off, the certification campaign either completes or, if any reviewers decided to revoke access for any of the involved identities, it moves into a remediation phase.\nIn the remediation phase, identities' entitlements are altered to remove any entitlements marked for revocation.\nIn this situation, the certification campaign completes once all the remediation requests are completed.\n\nThe end of a certification campaign is determined by its deadline, its completion status, or by an administrator's decision.\n\nFor more information about certifications and certification campaigns, refer to [Certifications](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/user-help/certs/reviewing/index.html).\n"

For example, two lifecycle states come by default with Identity Security Cloud: 'Active' and 'Inactive.'\nWhen an active employee takes an extended leave of absence from a company, his or her lifecycle state may change to 'Inactive,' for security purposes.\nThe inactive employee would lose access to all the applications, sources, and sensitive data during the leave of absence, but when the employee returns and becomes active again, all that access would be restored.\nThis saves administrators the time that would otherwise be spent provisioning the employee's access to each individual tool, reviewing the employee's certification history, etc.\n\nAdministrators must define the criteria for being in each lifecycle state, and they must define how Identity Security Cloud manages users' access to apps and sources for each lifecycle state.\n\nIn Identity Security Cloud, administrators can manage lifecycle states by going to Admin > Identities > Identity Profile, selecting the identity profile whose lifecycle states they want to manage, selecting the 'Provisioning' tab, and using the left panel to select the lifecycle state they want to modify.\n\nIn the 'Provisioning' tab, administrators can make the following access changes to an identity profile's lifecycle state:\n\n- Enable/disable the lifecycle state for the identity profile.\n\n- Enable/disable source accounts for the identity profile's lifecycle state.\n\n- Add existing access profiles to grant to the identity profiles in that lifecycle state.\n\n- Create a new access profile to grant to the identity profile in that lifecycle state.\n\nAccess profiles granted in a previous lifecycle state are automatically revoked when the identity moves to a new lifecycle state.\nTo maintain access across multiple lifecycle states, administrators must grant the access profiles in each lifecycle state.\nFor example, if an administrator wants users with the 'HR Employee' identity profile to maintain their building access in both the 'Active' and 'Leave of Absence' lifecycle states, the administrator must grant the access profile for that building access to both lifecycle states.\n\nDuring scheduled refreshes, Identity Security Cloud evaluates lifecycle states to determine whether their assigned identities have the access defined in the lifecycle states' access profiles.\nIf the identities are missing access, Identity Security Cloud provisions that access.\n\nAdministrators can also use the 'Provisioning' tab to configure email notifications for Identity Security Cloud to send whenever an identity with that identity profile has a lifecycle state change.\nRefer to [Configuring Lifecycle State Notifications](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/provisioning/lifecycle.html#configuring-lifecycle-state-notifications) for more information on how to do so.\n\nAn identity's lifecycle state can have four different statuses: the lifecycle state's status can be 'Active,' it can be 'Not Set,' it can be 'Not Valid,' or it 'Does Not Match Technical Name Case.'\nRefer to [Moving Identities into Lifecycle States](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/provisioning/lifecycle.html#moving-identities-into-lifecycle-states) for more information about these different lifecycle state statuses.\n\nRefer to [Setting Up Lifecycle States](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/provisioning/lifecycle.html) for more information about lifecycle states.\n"

      "description": "Use this API to implement and customize source functionality.\nWith source functionality in place, organizations can use Identity Security Cloud to connect their various sources and user data sets and manage access across all those different sources in a secure, scalable way.\n\n[Sources](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/sources/index.html) refer to the Identity Security Cloud representations for external applications, databases, and directory management systems that maintain their own sets of users, like Dropbox, GitHub, and Workday, for example.\nOrganizations may use hundreds, if not thousands, of different source systems, and any one employee within an organization likely has a different user record on each source, often with different permissions on many of those records.\nConnecting these sources to Identity Security Cloud makes it possible to manage user access across them all.\nThen, if a new hire starts at an organization, Identity Security Cloud can grant the new hire access to all the sources they need.\nIf an employee moves to a new department and needs access to new sources but no longer needs access to others, Identity Security Cloud can grant the necessary access and revoke the unnecessary access for all the employee's various sources.\nIf an employee leaves the company, Identity Security Cloud can revoke access to all the employee's various source accounts immediately.\nThese are just a few examples of the many ways that source functionality makes identity governance easier, more efficient, and more secure.\n\nIn Identity Security Cloud, administrators can create configure, manage, and edit sources, and they can designate other users as source admins to be able to do so.\nThey can also designate users as source sub-admins, who can perform the same source actions but only on sources associated with their governance groups.\nAdmins go to Connections > Sources to see a list of the existing source representations in their organizations.\nThey can create new sources or select existing ones.\n\nTo create a new source, the following must be specified: Source Name, Description, Source Owner, and Connection Type.\nRefer to [Configuring a Source](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/accounts/loading_data.html#configuring-a-source) for more information about the source configuration process.\n\nIdentity Security Cloud connects with its sources either by a direct communication with the source server (connection information specific to the source must be provided) or a flat file feed, a CSV file containing all the relevant information about the accounts to be loaded in.\nDifferent sources use different connectors to share data with Identity Security Cloud, and each connector's setup process is specific to that connector.\nSailPoint has built a number of connectors to come out of the box and connect to the most common sources, and SailPoint actively maintains these connectors.\nRefer to [Identity Security Cloud Connectors](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/connectors/identitynow/landingpages/help/landingpages/identitynow_connectivity_landing.html) for more information about these SailPoint supported connectors.\nRefer to the following links for more information about two useful connectors:\n\n- [JDBC Connector](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/connectors/jdbc/help/integrating_jdbc/introduction.html): This customizable connector an directly connect to databases that support JDBC (Java Database Connectivity).\n\n- [Web Services Connector](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/connectors/webservices/help/integrating_webservices/introduction.html): This connector can directly connect to databases that support Web Services.\n\nRefer to [SaaS Connectivity](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/connectivity/saas-connectivity/) for more information about SailPoint's new connectivity framework that makes it easy to build and manage custom connectors to SaaS sources.\n\nWhen admins select existing sources, they can view the following information about the source:\n\n- Associated connections (any associated identity profiles, apps, or references to the source in a transform).\n\n- Associated user accounts. These accounts are linked to their identities - this provides a more complete picture of each user's access across sources.\n\n- Associated entitlements (sets of access rights on sources).\n\n- Associated access profiles (groupings of entitlements).\n\nThe user account data and the entitlements update with each data aggregation from the source.\nOrganizations generally run scheduled, automated data aggregations to ensure that their data is always in sync between their sources and their Identity Security Cloud tenants so an access change on a source is detected quickly in Identity Security Cloud.\nAdmins can view a history of these aggregations, and they can also run manual imports.\nRefer to [Loading Account Data](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/accounts/loading_data.html) for more information about manual and scheduled aggregations.\n\nAdmins can also make changes to determine which user account data Identity Security Cloud collects from the source and how it correlates that account data with identity data.\nTo define which account attributes the source shares with Identity Security Cloud, admins can edit the account schema on the source.\nRefer to [Managing Source Account Schemas](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/accounts/schema.html) for more information about source account schemas and how to edit them.\nTo define the mapping between the source account attributes and their correlating identity attributes, admins can edit the correlation configuration on the source.\nRefer to [Assigning Source Accounts to Identities](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/accounts/correlation.html) for more information about this correlation process between source accounts and identities.\n\nAdmins can also delete sources, but they must first ensure that the sources no longer have any active connections: the source must not be associated with any identity profile or any app, and it must not be referenced by any transform.\nRefer to [Deleting Sources](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/sources/index.html#deleting-sources) for more information about deleting sources.\n\nWell organized, mapped out connections between sources and Identity Security Cloud are essential to achieving comprehensive identity access governance across all the source systems organizations need.\nRefer to [Managing Sources](https://documentation.sailpoint.com/saas/help/sources/index.html) for more information about all the different things admins can do with sources once they are connected.\n"

        "description": "Use this API to submit an access request in Identity Security Cloud (ISC), where it follows any ISC approval processes.\n\n:::info\nThe ability to request access using this API is constrained by the Access Request Segments defined in the API token’s user context.\n:::\n\nAccess requests are processed asynchronously by ISC. A successful response from this endpoint means that the request\nhas been submitted to ISC and is queued for processing. Because this endpoint is asynchronous, it doesn't return an error\nif you submit duplicate access requests in quick succession or submit an access request for access that is already in progress, approved, or rejected.\n\nIt's best practice to check for any existing access requests that reference the same access items before submitting a new access request. This can\nbe accomplished by using the [List Access Request Status](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/list-access-request-status) or the [Pending Access Request Approvals](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/list-pending-approvals) APIs. You can also\nuse the [Search API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/search) to check the existing access items an identity has before submitting\nan access request to ensure that you aren't requesting access that is already granted. If you use this API to request access that an identity already has, \nwithout changing the account details or end date information from the existing assignment, \nthe API will cancel the request as a duplicate.\n\nThere are two types of access request:\n\n__GRANT_ACCESS__\n* Can be requested for multiple identities in a single request.\n* Supports self request and request on behalf of other users. Refer to the [Get Access Request Configuration](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/get-access-request-config) endpoint for request configuration options.  \n* Allows any authenticated token (except API) to call this endpoint to request to grant access to themselves. Depending on the configuration, a user can request access for others.\n* Roles, access profiles and entitlements can be requested.\n* You can specify a `removeDate` to set or alter a sunset date-time on an assignment. The removeDate must be a future date-time, in the UTC timezone. Additionally, if the user already has the access assigned with a sunset date, you can also submit a request without a `removeDate` to request removal of the sunset date and time.\n* If a `removeDate` is specified, then the requested role, access profile, or entitlement will be removed on that date and time.\n* Now supports an alternate field 'requestedForWithRequestedItems' for users to specify account selections while requesting items where they have more than one account on the source.\n\n:::caution\n\nIf any entitlements are being requested, then the maximum number of entitlements that can be requested is 25, and the maximum number of identities that can be requested for is 10. If you exceed these limits, the request will fail with a 400 error. If you are not requesting any entitlements, then there are no limits.\n\n:::\n\n__REVOKE_ACCESS__\n* Can only be requested for a single identity at a time.\n* You cannot use an access request to revoke access from an identity if that access has been granted by role membership or by birthright provisioning. \n* Does not support self request. Only manager can request to revoke access for their directly managed employees.\n* If a `removeDate` is specified, then the requested role, access profile, or entitlement will be removed on that date and time.\n* Roles, access profiles, and entitlements can be requested for revocation.\n* Revoke requests for entitlements are limited to 1 entitlement per access request currently.\n* You can specify a `removeDate` to add or alter a sunset date and time on an assignment. The `removeDate` must be a future date-time, in the UTC timezone. If the user already has the access assigned with a sunset date and time, the removeDate must be a date-time earlier than the existing sunset date and time. \n* Allows a manager to request to revoke access for direct employees. A user with ORG_ADMIN authority can also request to revoke access from anyone.\n* Now supports REVOKE_ACCESS requests for identities with multiple accounts on a single source, with the help of 'assignmentId' and 'nativeIdentity' fields. These fields should be used within the 'requestedItems' section for the revoke requests. \n* Usage of 'requestedForWithRequestedItems' field is not supported for revoke requests.\n",

        "description": "This API is used to set a password for an identity. \n\nAn identity can change their own password (as well as any of their accounts' passwords) if they use a token generated by their ISC user, such as a [personal access token](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#personal-access-tokens) or [\"authorization_code\" derived OAuth token](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#authorization-code-grant-flow).\n\nA token with [API authority](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/authentication#client-credentials-grant-flow) can be used to change **any** identity's password or the password of any of the identity's accounts. \n\"API authority\" refers to a token that only has the \"client_credentials\" grant type.\n\n>**Note: If you want to set an identity's source account password, you must enable `PASSWORD` as one of the source's features. You can use the [PATCH Source endpoint](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v3/update-source) to add the `PASSWORD` feature.**\n\nYou can use this endpoint to generate an `encryptedPassword` (RSA encrypted using publicKey). \nTo do so, follow these steps:\n\n1. Use [Query Password Info](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/query-password-info) to get the following information: `identityId`, `sourceId`, `publicKeyId`, `publicKey`, `accounts`, and `policies`. \n\n2. Choose an account from the previous response that you will provide as an `accountId` in your request to set an encrypted password. \n\n3. Use [Set Identity's Password](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/set-password) and provide the information you got from your earlier query. Then add this code to your request to get the encrypted password:\n\n```java\nimport javax.crypto.Cipher;\nimport java.security.KeyFactory;\nimport java.security.PublicKey;\nimport java.security.spec.X509EncodedKeySpec;\nimport java util.Base64;\n\nString encrypt(String publicKey, String toEncrypt) throws Exception {\n  byte[] publicKeyBytes = Base64.getDecoder().decode(publicKey);\n  byte[] encryptedBytes = encryptRsa(publicKeyBytes, toEncrypt.getBytes(\"UTF-8\"));\n  return Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(encryptedBytes);\n}\n\nprivate byte[] encryptRsa(byte[] publicKeyBytes, byte[] toEncryptBytes) throws Exception {\n  PublicKey key = KeyFactory.getInstance(\"RSA\").generatePublic(new X509EncodedKeySpec(publicKeyBytes));\n  String transformation = \"RSA/ECB/PKCS1Padding\";\n  Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(transformation);\n  cipher.init(1, key);\n  return cipher.doFinal(toEncryptBytes);\n}\n```    \n\nIn this example, `toEncrypt` refers to the plain text password you are setting and then encrypting, and the `publicKey` refers to the publicKey you got from the first request you sent. \n\nYou can then use [Get Password Change Request Status](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/v3/get-password-change-status) to check the password change request status. To do so, you must provide the `requestId` from your earlier request to set the password. \n",

You can then do either of the following: \n\n  - Filter to find relevant workflow executions.\n  For example, you can filter for failed workflow executions: `GET /workflows/:workflowID/executions?filters=status eq \"Failed\"`\n\n  - Paginate through results with the `offset` parameter. \n  For example, you can page through 50 executions per page and use that as a way to get to the records past the first 250. \n  Refer to [Paginating Results](https://developer.sailpoint.com/idn/api/standard-collection-parameters#paginating-results) for more information about the query parameters you can use to achieve pagination.

        "description": "Optional features that can be supported by a source. Modifying the features array may cause source configuration errors that are unsupportable. It is recommended to not modify this array for SailPoint supported connectors.\n* AUTHENTICATE: The source supports pass-through authentication.\n* COMPOSITE: The source supports composite source creation.\n* DIRECT_PERMISSIONS: The source supports returning DirectPermissions.\n* DISCOVER_SCHEMA: The source supports discovering schemas for users and groups.\n* ENABLE The source supports reading if an account is enabled or disabled.\n* MANAGER_LOOKUP: The source supports looking up managers as they are encountered in a feed. This is the opposite of NO_RANDOM_ACCESS.\n* NO_RANDOM_ACCESS: The source does not support random access and the getObject() methods should not be called and expected to perform.\n* PROXY: The source can serve as a proxy for another source. When an source has a proxy, all connector calls made with that source are redirected through the connector for the proxy source.\n* SEARCH\n* TEMPLATE\n* UNLOCK: The source supports reading if an account is locked or unlocked.\n* UNSTRUCTURED_TARGETS: The source supports returning unstructured Targets.\n* SHAREPOINT_TARGET: The source supports returning unstructured Target data for SharePoint. It will be typically used by AD, LDAP sources.\n* PROVISIONING: The source can both read and write accounts. Having this feature implies that the provision() method is implemented. It also means that direct and target permissions can also be provisioned if they can be returned by aggregation.\n* GROUP_PROVISIONING: The source can both read and write groups. Having this feature implies that the provision() method is implemented.\n* SYNC_PROVISIONING: The source can provision accounts synchronously.\n* PASSWORD: The source can provision password changes. Since sources can never read passwords, this is should only be used in conjunction with the PROVISIONING feature.\n* CURRENT_PASSWORD: Some source types support verification of the current password\n* ACCOUNT_ONLY_REQUEST: The source supports requesting accounts without entitlements.\n* ADDITIONAL_ACCOUNT_REQUEST: The source supports requesting additional accounts.\n* NO_AGGREGATION: A source that does not support aggregation.\n* GROUPS_HAVE_MEMBERS: The source models group memberships with a member attribute on the group object rather than a groups attribute on the account object. This effects the implementation of delta account aggregation.\n* NO_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING: Indicates that the connector cannot provision direct or target permissions for accounts. When DIRECT_PERMISSIONS and PROVISIONING features are present, it is assumed that the connector can also provision direct permissions. This feature disables that assumption and causes permission request to be converted to work items for accounts.\n* NO_GROUP_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING: Indicates that the connector cannot provision direct or target permissions for groups. When DIRECT_PERMISSIONS and PROVISIONING features are present, it is assumed that the connector can also provision direct permissions. This feature disables that assumption and causes permission request to be converted to work items for groups.\n* NO_UNSTRUCTURED_TARGETS_PROVISIONING: This string will be replaced by NO_GROUP_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING and NO_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING.\n* NO_DIRECT_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING: This string will be replaced by NO_GROUP_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING and NO_PERMISSIONS_PROVISIONING.\n* USES_UUID: Connectivity 2.0 flag used to indicate that the connector supports a compound naming structure.\n* PREFER_UUID: Used in ISC Provisioning AND Aggregation to decide if it should prefer account.uuid to account.nativeIdentity when data is read in through aggregation OR pushed out through provisioning.\n* ARM_SECURITY_EXTRACT: Indicates the application supports Security extracts for ARM\n* ARM_UTILIZATION_EXTRACT: Indicates the application supports Utilization extracts for ARM\n* ARM_CHANGELOG_EXTRACT: Indicates the application supports Change-log extracts for ARM",
