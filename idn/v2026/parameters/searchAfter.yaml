        Used to begin the search window at the values specified.


        This parameter consists of the last values of the sorted fields in the current record set.


        searchAfter length must match the number of sorters.


        This is used to expand the Elasticsearch limit of 10K records by shifting the 10K window to begin at this value.


        It is recommended that you always include the ID of the object in addition to any other fields on this parameter in order to ensure you don't get duplicate results while paging.


        For example, if you are sorting by name you will also want to include ID, for example searchAfter=Account Payable,2c91808375d8e80a0175e1f88a575221&sorters=name,id.


        If the last entitlement ID in the search result is 2c91808375d8e80a0175e1f88a575221 and the last name is "Account Payable", then using that name and ID will start a new search after this entitlement.
      required: false
      example: Account Payable,2c91808375d8e80a0175e1f88a575221
